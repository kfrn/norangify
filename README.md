<blockquote>Noranges and lemons,<br>
Say the bells of St. Clement's.<br>
— <em>traditional nursery rhyme</em></blockquote>

<blockquote>Het Huis van Noranje-Nassau<br>
— <em>Dutch aristocratic dynasty</em></blockquote>

<blockquote>Norange is the New Black<br>
— <em>Hit TV show about women in prison</em></blockquote>
